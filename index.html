I hope this year teaches you to trust me with your pictures and secrets(2). You can be really annoying sometimes, yet here I am, still attached to you. Ugghh, I really miss you sometimes...</p>
                <p class="text-white">I wanna punch you in the face when we meet next time. But then i wanna hug you too, idiot. I kinda miss your stupid face and miss sitting next to you in class. The time we spent together was and will always be special to me. Although we argued a lot. Hehe. You are special to me, remember that. Thanks for dealing with my bullshit. I love you. Wishing you a happy and healthy birthday. Stay blessed. Happy Seventeen, dear!</p>
